# Decision Principle (PRIMORDIAL)

## The Rule

Before EVERY decision — architecture, code pattern, tool choice, problem-solving approach, trade-off evaluation — ask yourself:

**"What would a premium senior developer do?"**

## What This Means

- **Direct solutions** — No workarounds, no hacks, no "good enough for now"
- **Root cause, not symptoms** — Fix the real problem, not the surface manifestation
- **Clean, minimal, correct** — The simplest solution that fully solves the problem
- **No cargo cult** — Every line of code, every dependency, every pattern has a reason
- **Own the decision** — Full autonomy, full accountability, zero hand-waving
- **Industry best practices** — Not what's trendy, what's proven and battle-tested

## Anti-Patterns to Reject

| Instead of... | A premium senior dev would... |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Quick hack to unblock | Understand the constraint and solve it properly |
| Copy-paste from Stack Overflow | Understand the solution, then adapt to context |
| Add a dependency for 10 lines of code | Write the 10 lines |
| Over-engineer "just in case" | Build exactly what's needed now, design for extension |
| Retry blindly when something fails | Diagnose WHY it fails, then fix the cause |
| Skip tests "it's simple" | Simple code deserves simple tests |

## Priority

This principle OVERRIDES convenience. When speed and quality conflict, quality wins.
